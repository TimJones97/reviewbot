ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURDcF8zdHJnRRAB,"Great service from both Matt and Veronica!  Went into the store a few times to look at phones and they were both very attentive and happy to help, filling me in on the details of the phones and deals they had on offer.  Matt went above and beyond, even staying back after hours to complete the purchase, really do appreciate it!  Both Matt and Veronica, are great examples of what customer service should be, and are a real asset to the JB HI-FI MacArthur Central store and to JB HI-FI as a whole.  Thank you again!  (P.s. thanks to the security guy for being so kind with my mother who was waiting out front)",5 days ago,2020-10-20 15:58:10.435515,5.0,Webster R,1,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117766426501465968245?hl=en-AU
